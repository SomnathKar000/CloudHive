CloudHive is a web application that allows users to securely upload and manage files in the cloud. This repository contains the frontend code for the CloudHive project. It is built using React, Material-UI, Redux with Redux Thunk for state management, and Axios for API calls. The project is built with Vite for fast and efficient development.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with React and Material-UI to provide a visually appealing and intuitive user interface.

- **State Management:** Utilizes Redux with Redux Thunk for efficient state management and asynchronous actions.

- **API Calls:** Communicates with the CloudHive-Backend API using Axios for seamless data exchange.

- **Vite Build:** The project is built using Vite for a faster and more efficient development experience.

## Getting Started
